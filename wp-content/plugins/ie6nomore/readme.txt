== Description ==

Applies the ie6nomore.com code that encourages IE6 users to upgrade to a more modern browser.

This plugin only applies the ie6nomore.com code if your blog visitors are using Microsoft Internet Explorer. And, in tandem with <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms537512(VS.85,loband).aspx">conditional comments</a>, will only display the notification box on versions lower than IE7.

From the IE6 No More website:

**Why?**

Enough is enough. Microsoft Internet Explorer 6 was released in late 2001. For its time, it was a decent browser, but in 2009, it is still in use by a significant portion of the web population, and its time is now up.

As any web developer will tell you, working with IE 6 is one of the most difficult and frustrating things they have to deal with on a daily basis, taking up a disproportionate amount of their time. Beyond that, IE 6's support for modern web standards is very lacking, restricting what developers can create and holding the web back.

**What?**

This website is run by a group of people who want to see IE 6 disappear as soon as possible. To help make that happen, we're encouraging the IE 6 users of our websites to upgrade to a more modern browser, so they can have a better experience using our sites and browsing the web.
